# Frontend Task

In this small task you are required to develop a 3 page long application for a configurator project. In this folder you will find 3 image files that shows the layout of the pages and an images folder with images that you can use for all configurations.

In the images folder you will find small and large images for all the options.

A small video showing how the application should work, can be viewed here:  [https://vimeo.com/533441776/79a483edc9](https://vimeo.com/533441776/79a483edc9)

## Requirements

1) The application should be created in React with functional components and hooks. 
2) You are flexible to use any state management tools.
3) For Routing we would recommend React Router V5 unless the application is built using NextJS or GatsbyJS.

## Extra credits
You can get some extra credits if the application will be built with NextJS or GatsbyJS


## Optional
1) We don't look for a pixel perfect solution, so making the application pixel perfect is up to you.
2) We don't require a responsive design.
3) There's no requirements for CSS, you are free to use SCSS, LESS, Styled components, or anything you are comfortable with.
4) It's up to you to decide if you want to use the large and small images from the "/images" folder or optimise the images using code.
5) We don't require testings or TypeScript for this application.

## Outcome
For the outcome we would like to see a working application where the user can configure the apartment and all the configurations are being stored. 

## Delivery

Please add the project to a private git repository and add commit messages to the most important (in your opinion) features. At the end of the task send us the link to the repository. 
Please share the repository with: radu.brega@gmail.com
